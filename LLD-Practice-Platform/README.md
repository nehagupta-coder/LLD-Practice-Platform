## 📌 Overview

**LLD Practice Platform** is an MVP designed to help software
engineering learners practice **Low-Level Design** through a structured
learning workflow.

The platform is built around a simple learning loop:

```text
Choose Problem
      ↓
Think / Design
      ↓
Submit Solution
      ↓
Get Feedback
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Try Again
```

Instead of focusing only on writing code, the platform focuses on the
learner's **design thinking, object modeling, responsibilities,
relationships, extensibility, and reasoning**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

LLD learners often create designs without knowing:

- Whether their design is structured correctly
- Whether responsibilities are assigned properly
- Which concepts they missed
- Whether their classes are well modeled
- How their design can be improved
- Whether their second attempt is better than their first attempt

The platform addresses these problems through:

- Clear LLD problem requirements
- Structured design workspace
- Class and relationship modeling
- Design submission
- Dimension-wise evaluation
- Actionable feedback
- Attempt history
- Retry and iteration
- Progress tracking

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

The LLD Practice Platform is deployed and available online.

| Service | Link |
|---|---|
| 🌐 Frontend | https://lld-practice-platform-t5f1-two.vercel.app |
| ⚙️ Backend API | https://lld-practice-platform-api-ce9w.onrender.com |
| ❤️ API Health | https://lld-practice-platform-api-ce9w.onrender.com/api/health |

### Quick Start

👉 **[Open Live Application](https://lld-practice-platform-t5f1-two.vercel.app)**

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 📚 Problem Library

Learners can browse LLD problems with:

- Title
- Description
- Difficulty
- Estimated time
- Tags
- Practice status
- Search
- Filtering

---

### 📖 Problem Details

Each problem provides:

- Problem statement
- Functional requirements
- Assumptions
- Difficulty
- Estimated time
- Expected design areas
- Relevant tags

This helps learners understand the problem before starting the design.

---

### 🧠 Structured Design Workspace

Instead of using one large text box, learners can structure their
solution into multiple sections.

Learners can submit:

- Requirements
- Assumptions
- Classes
- Attributes
- Methods
- Responsibilities
- Relationships
- Design explanation
- Optional code
- Optional pseudocode

The workspace also supports **saving drafts before submission**.

---

### 📝 Structured Evaluation

Each submission can be evaluated across multiple LLD dimensions.

| Dimension | Score |
|---|---:|
| Requirement Understanding | /10 |
| Object/Class Modeling | /10 |
| Responsibility Assignment | /10 |
| Encapsulation | /10 |
| Relationships | /10 |
| Extensibility | /10 |
| Design Patterns | /10 |
| Simplicity | /10 |
| Code/Pseudocode Quality | /10 |
| Design Reasoning | /10 |

The evaluation provides:

- Overall score
- Dimension-wise scores
- Strengths
- Improvements
- Missing concepts
- Recommended next steps

---

## 🤖 AI Evaluation

The platform is designed with an abstraction layer for AI-powered
evaluation.

It can integrate with:

- Claude API
- OpenAI API
- Mock evaluator

The evaluator receives:

```text
Problem Requirements
        +
Learner Submission
        +
Evaluation Rubric
        ↓
AI / Mock Evaluator
        ↓
Structured JSON Feedback
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "overallScore": 78,
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "name": "Requirement Understanding",
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The main requirements are covered clearly."
    },
    {
      "name": "Responsibility Assignment",
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "Some responsibilities are concentrated in one class."
    }
  ],
  "strengths": [],
  "improvements": [],
  "missingConcepts": [],
  "nextSteps": []
}
```

---

## 🧪 Mock Evaluation

The application can work without an external AI API key.

Set:

```env
AI_PROVIDER=mock
```

The mock evaluator provides deterministic feedback for demonstrations
and development.

This allows the product to remain usable even when no external AI
provider is configured.

---

## 🔄 Attempt History

Every submission is stored as an attempt.

Learners can review:

- Problem
- Attempt number
- Date
- Score
- Submission
- Evaluation
- Improvement areas

Learners can also start another attempt after reviewing feedback.

This makes the platform focused on **iteration instead of one-time
submission**.

---

## 📊 Dashboard

The dashboard provides useful learning information such as:

- Problems attempted
- Problems completed
- Total attempts
- Average score
- Best score
- Recent activity
- Recommended problems

The goal is to show meaningful learning progress without unnecessary
analytics.

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

The progress section helps learners understand their practice history.

It can show:

- Problem-wise performance
- Latest score
- Best score
- Attempt count
- Completed problems
- Improvement over time

---

# 🧠 Product Decisions

## Why Structured Submission?

A single large text box makes it difficult to evaluate individual LLD
dimensions.

Structured fields make the learner's thinking easier to understand and
allow more targeted feedback.

---

## Why Feedback Instead of Only a Score?

A score alone does not explain how the learner should improve.

The platform therefore focuses on:

```text
Score
  +
Strengths
  +
Problems
  +
Missing Concepts
  +
Next Steps
```

---

## Why Attempt History?

LLD improves through iteration.

Previous attempts help learners understand whether their design
decisions are improving.

---

## Why Mock AI?

The product should remain usable without an external API key.

Mock evaluation makes the MVP easy to demonstrate while keeping the
architecture ready for real AI providers.

---

## Why Avoid Over-Engineering?

The assignment focuses on product thinking and the learner workflow.

Technologies such as:

- Kubernetes
- Microservices
- Complex real-time systems
- Unnecessary infrastructure

do not directly improve the core learning loop for this MVP.

---

# 🎯 Evaluation Philosophy

The evaluator should consider:

- Requirement understanding
- Appropriate abstraction
- Class modeling
- Responsibility assignment
- Encapsulation
- Relationships
- Extensibility
- Design patterns
- Simplicity
- Design reasoning

Feedback should explain **why** a change may improve the design and
provide a concrete direction for improvement.

Example:

> Instead of placing parking allocation and pricing logic inside
> `ParkingLot`, consider separating these responsibilities into
> dedicated components.

---

# 🛡️ Error Handling

The application should gracefully handle:

- Invalid submissions
- Missing required fields
- API failures
- Database failures
- Missing problems
- AI provider failures
- Invalid AI responses
- Empty states

Users should receive understandable messages instead of raw stack
traces.

---

# ⏳ Loading States

Important operations should show clear status messages:

```text
Loading problems...
Saving draft...
Submitting...
Evaluating your design...
```

---

# 🎨 Design Principles

## Focus on the Learner

Every feature should help the learner practice or understand LLD better.

## Make Feedback Actionable

Avoid generic feedback such as:

> Improve your design.

Prefer feedback such as:

> ParkingLot currently handles both allocation and pricing. Consider
> separating these responsibilities so each component has a clearer
> purpose.

## Keep the MVP Narrow

The product should demonstrate the core learning loop instead of
attempting to solve every possible learning problem.

## Make Iteration Easy

The learner should be able to move from feedback directly into another
attempt.

---

# 🚫 Intentionally Out of Scope

The MVP does not require:

- Kubernetes
- Microservices
- Complex authentication
- Real-time collaboration
- Video courses
- Live instructor sessions
- Large-scale social features
- Advanced gamification
- Complex recommendation engines
- Production-scale distributed infrastructure

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

- Interactive UML/Class Diagram Editor
- Automatic Diagram Analysis
- Personalized Problem Recommendations
- Adaptive Difficulty
- Peer Review
- Instructor Review
- Code Execution
- Deeper AI Evaluation
- Learning Streaks
- Topic-Level Mastery
- Personalized Revision Plans
- Collaborative Design Sessions
- Interview Simulation Mode

---

# ✅ Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when a learner can:

1. Select an LLD problem.
2. Understand the requirements.
3. Create a structured design.
4. Save or submit the design.
5. Receive meaningful evaluation.
6. Review strengths and weaknesses.
7. Open previous attempts.
8. Start another attempt.
9. Use feedback to improve.

# ⭐ Project Philosophy

LLD is not learned by reading class diagrams alone.

It improves through:

```text
Practice
